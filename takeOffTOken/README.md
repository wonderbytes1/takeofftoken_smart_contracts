# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
You need to set your API URL of alchemy or any other service provider in hardhat.config.js
npm install
npx hardhat test
```
