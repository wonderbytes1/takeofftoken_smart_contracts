# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```
1)Run command "npm install --force" for installing the required packages.
2)Paste your api key of alchemy or infura in the hardhat.config.js.
3)For running test cases, just type 'npx hardhat coverage'
```
